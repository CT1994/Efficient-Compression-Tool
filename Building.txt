Makefile Build:
Use the Makefile to build  dependencies and the binary:
cd src/
make deps
make

Xcode Build (Mac only):
Build the dependencies first:
cd src/
make deps
Then, open the Xcode Project and compile the program.


If you want Support for optimizing all files in a folder, you need to link the Boost.Filesystem and Boost.System libraries (boost.org) and define BOOST_SUPPORTED in main.cpp.
This is already done in the Xcode project. In both cases you need to have Boost installed.

Dependencies:
Make
NASM
Boost (optional)

Tested Operating Systems and Compilers:
Debian Wheezy (GCC)
Mac OS X 10.10 (GCC and LLVM/Clang)
Windows 8 (MinGW)
For using other compilers than GCC, you may need to change the Makefile.
